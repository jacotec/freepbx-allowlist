## Superfecta module for Tellows
This module can be used for Spam detection against the Tellows online service (German speaking area) and to create a caller spam filtering with allowed callers bypass in conjunction with the modified Allowlist module.

Thanks to @Igaetz in the FreePBX forum for his idea and the initial work on this script.
